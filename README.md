## About

</p>

[Anime Selection ](https://www.animeselection.com) is a React web app, dedicated to the best and most influential anime ever, built with responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in React, as well as how to read data from a third-party API.

It works like a catalog, consuming real anime data from the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/), allowing users to search the [MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net/) catalog, read a short description of each anime, get information from the creators, and watch trailers. I've also used the [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) for your page as it has more accurate information. I have also created a "favorites.json" file on my server to make my own list, due to the limitations of MyAnimeList.net.

IÂ´ve not used any library for the visual elements, except for the Material UI icon pack. The buttons, navigation bars, dropdown list, menus, and other visual components were created with CSS.
